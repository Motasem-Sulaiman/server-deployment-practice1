we talked about CI\CD: its a way to write our code and make steps to be sure our code is working perfectly 

and create a code if theres any problem it will fail our pull request on github


We learned about MiddleWare : its a function that excecuted before the response
and theres a global Middleware that excecute for all functions before send the response

we learned how to create a saparete index.js file and use it as entry point using Module.exports


and we talked about errorHandlers to handle erros that should happen like enter incorrect path or a logical error using 404 and 500 

and we used TDD and created test that test our code before we deploy it on github to avoid errors
